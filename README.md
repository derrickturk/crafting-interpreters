Notes, implementations, etc. on "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom

- `surimi`: a "boring" (mostly) C# port of the part 1 interpreter from Java  
- `loxide`: a Rust implementation of a Lox interpreter  
- `saumon_fum√©`: Lox interpreter in OCaml, excluding the OO features, because `super` nearly killed me  
- `dishwasher_salmon`: basically `clox` with some tweaks TBD
